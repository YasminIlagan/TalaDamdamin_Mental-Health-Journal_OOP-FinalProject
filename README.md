🚀 OOP Principles in Action

Encapsulation

EntryJournal Class: Manages journal data while keeping entries and operations secure.

DatabaseConnection Class: Centralizes database logic for streamlined management.

Abstraction

Simplifies database interactions via a dedicated DatabaseConnection class.

High-level methods like addJournalEntry() allow users to interact seamlessly without knowing implementation details.

Inheritance

Prepare for scalability! Subclasses like TherapistUser or MoodEntry can inherit and extend core classes for additional functionality.

Polymorphism

Dynamically adapt methods like addJournalEntry() to user input.

Lay the groundwork for method overloading to support enhanced entry customization.
