🚀 OOP Principles in Action

1️⃣ Encapsulation

User Class: Safeguards user-specific data like username and password with private attributes and public getters.

EntryJournal Class: Manages journal data while keeping entries and operations secure.

DatabaseConnection Class: Centralizes database logic for streamlined management.

2️⃣ Abstraction

Simplifies database interactions via a dedicated DatabaseConnection class.

High-level methods like addJournalEntry() allow users to interact seamlessly without knowing implementation details.

3️⃣ Inheritance

Prepare for scalability! Subclasses like TherapistUser or MoodEntry can inherit and extend core classes for additional functionality.

4️⃣ Polymorphism

Dynamically adapt methods like addJournalEntry() to user input.

Lay the groundwork for method overloading to support enhanced entry customization.

🎉 Benefits

Readable code, reusable components, maintainable structure, and future-ready scalability!
